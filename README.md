## Hi!  I'm Michael Dunn-O'Connor

As an AI Technical Lead and educator, I bridge the gap between emerging technology and the developer community. I specialize in creating engaging technical content, including articles and videos, derived directly from software engineer feedback.

A passionate community builder, I have delivered weekly workshops and large-scale presentations on generative AI to hundreds of developers and data analysts. My background in education and coaching informs my approach, which has helped engineers increase their adoption of new AI tools by 70% in a single month.
